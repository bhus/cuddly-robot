FOREWARD
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scala has been on my periphery since I graduated into the workforce.
 At the time,
 the JVM was even still in it's infancy.
 As the Java community grew,
 along with the online world and copmurer science more broadly,
 scala has grown to meet the needs of its community time and again.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What has struck me most,
 though,
 is the *caliber* of people that have consistently been involved in the project over time.
 The very brightest people I know in the field of computer science have been involved in its development since it's inception.
 Indeed,
 is it quite possibly the most *academically-influenced* language in the Java world,
 and perhaps even in the broader community.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Along with this has come it's persistent,
 unyielding insistence that it is an at least *two-paradigm* language.
 It shunned the unilateral insistence of every other lanugage to focus on a single paradigm,
 pairing Object -Oriented appraoches with Functional ones,
 and has never let go either influence.
 This is truly unique.

PREFACE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scala is a language that has a reputation for complexity and difficulty,
 but this attitude is entirely an artifact of a bygone era.
 It was the first to introduce many programming paradigms that have since been adopted into many other mainstream languages that are not cast in this light.
 The truth is scala is a harbinger of new ideas and idioms,
 and is one of the most academically scrutinized languages.
 This paper will lead the reader on a refreshed introduction,
 starting from minimal assumptions,
 and hopefully provide a jumping off point for whatever the reader wants to build.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A note should be made here regarding modern LLMs – they are a powerful tool that has made the act of creation *much* more streamlined,
 and indeed has removed many barriers to building software.
 As a result,
 the choice of language used should be less influenced by

what currently exists

,
 and should leave the door wide open for devs to choose their own language to build in going forward.
 There has never been a better time to explore the choice of language,
 particularly for the backend.
 scala is definitely a

 of languages,
 and there has never been a better time to learn and implement with it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our approach will therefore be to first and foremost get you up and going.
 From there we will get a working example going & explore some basic scala.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once we reach a level of comfort with this,
 we will give a brief overview of the basic structures and highlights of the language.
